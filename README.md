# Customer_segmentation_and_recommendation
A recommendation system that will suggest top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet

# Problem
In this project, the aim is to transform transactional data into a customer-centric dataset by creating new features that will facilitate the segmentation of customers into distinct groups using the K-means clustering algorithm. This segmentation will allow us to understand the unique profiles and preferences of various customer groups, thus amplifying the efficiency of marketing strategies and fostering increased sales. Subsequently, we intend to develop a recommendation system that suggests top-selling products to customers within each segment who haven't purchased those items yet, enhancing marketing efficacy and fostering increased sales.

# Objectives

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Undertake data cleaning by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers to prepare the dataset for effective clustering.

Feature Engineering: Develop new features based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the stage for customer segmentation.

Data Preprocessing: Conduct feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline data, enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.

Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering: Segment customers into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.

Cluster Analysis & Evaluation: Analyze and profile each cluster to develop targeted marketing strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.

Recommendation System: Develop a system to recommend best-selling products to customers within the same cluster who haven't purchased those products, aiming to enhance sales and marketing effectiveness.
